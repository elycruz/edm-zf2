===========================================
Edm - Extensible Data Management System.

The system is written with Zend Framework 2 and mysql for it's database (see elycruz/edm-db-mysql).
Also the system will follow a TDD approach where we test first and write service and business process code later.

More documentation coming soon.

### Todos:

#### 0.3.0 MVP
- [ ] - Add tests:
    - [ ] - Tests for `Edm\Db`:
        - [ ] - Tests for `Edm\Db\DatabaseDataHelper`.
        - [ ] - Tests for `Edm\Db\TableGateway`.
        - [ ] - Tests for `Edm\Db\ResultSet\Proto`.
    - [X] - Tests for `Edm\InputFilter\DefaultInputOptions`.
- [ ] - Re-evaluate how 'aliases' are used in the EDM system.
- [ ] - Add UML diagrams of system.
- [ ] - Add UML diagrams of the database (edm-db-mysql) as it stands.
- [ ] - Add RDBMS as git sub-module to the project.

#### Other:
 - [ ] - Look into using `Expressive`

#### Other tasks
 - [ ] List all forms in module.config.php so that we can take advantage of
    the service manager's features.

#### 1.0.0 MVP
- [ ] - Add routes management from the cms
- [ ] - Add module management from the cms
- [ ] - Add controller management from the cms
- [ ] - Add action management from the cms
- [ ] - Maybe implement the aforementioned via something like the following in
the ui:
    - refresh controllers list
    - refresh actions list
    - refresh routes list

##### Ideas for aforementioned:
- [ ] - Maybe add an extra directory for loading `Edm` "generated" configs.
- [ ] - Generate, backup, and re-write configs (routes, module config, controller, and action configs from edm or other module);
- [ ] - Maybe do introspection of modules, controller directories and the like to populate cms page for managing routes module

more to come as development continues.
