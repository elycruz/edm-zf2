===========================================
Edm - The Extensible Data Management System

The system is written with Zend Framework 2 and mysql for it's database (see elycruz/edm-db-mysql).
Also the system will follow a TDD approach where we test first and write service and business process code later.

More documentation coming soon.

### Todos:

#### 0.3.0 MVP
- [ ] - Add tests:
    - [ ] - `Edm\Db`:
        - [X] - `Edm\Db\DatabaseDataHelper`.
        - [ ] - `Edm\Db\TableGateway`:
        - [ ] - `Edm\Db\ResultSet\Proto`.
            - [X] - `Edm\Db\ResultSet\Proto\AbstractProto`.
            - [X] - `Edm\Db\ResultSet\Proto\ProtoInterface`.
            - [X] - `Edm\Db\ResultSet\Proto\TermProto`.
            - [X] - `Edm\Db\ResultSet\Proto\TermTaxonomyProto`.
    - [X] - `Edm\InputFilter\DefaultInputOptions`.
    - [X] - `Edm\InputFilter\DefaultInputOptionsAware`.
    - [X] - `Edm\Filter`:
        - [X] - `Edm\Filter\Alias`.
        - [X] - `Edm\Filter\Slug`.
- [X] - Re-evaluate how 'aliases' are used in the EDM system.
    Resources:
        - valid url characters stackoverflow: (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4669692/valid-characters-for-directory-part-of-a-url-for-short-links)
    Findings:
        - Slugs are the same as object aliases (dash separated words with no punctuation).
        - Slugs can be used the same way we use aliases in our edm application.
        - Slug/alias (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_URL#Slug)
        - Slug (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slug_(publishing))
- [ ] - Add UML diagrams of system.
- [ ] - Add UML diagrams of the database (edm-db-mysql) as it stands.
- [ ] - Add RDBMS as git sub-module to the project.

#### Other:
 - [ ] - Look into using `Expressive`

#### Other tasks
 - [ ] List all forms in module.config.php so that we can take advantage of
    the service manager's features.

#### 1.0.0 MVP
- [ ] - Add routes management from the cms
- [ ] - Add module management from the cms
- [ ] - Add controller management from the cms
- [ ] - Add action management from the cms
- [ ] - Maybe implement the aforementioned via something like the following in
the ui:
    - refresh controllers list
    - refresh actions list
    - refresh routes list

##### Ideas for aforementioned:
- [ ] - Maybe add an extra directory for loading `Edm` "generated" configs.
- [ ] - Generate, backup, and re-write configs (routes, module config, controller, and action configs from edm or other module);
- [ ] - Maybe do introspection of modules, controller directories and the like to populate cms page for managing routes module

more to come as development continues.
